# Achievement Unlocked: Vista 100% Operational üèÜ

**Date:** July 5, 2025  
**Location:** Warsaw  
**Impact:** Critical production fixes

## What I Fixed

### 1. FFmpeg Audio Crisis
- **Problem:** Large WAV files (12MB+) caused 500 errors
- **Solution:** Added preprocessing pipeline converting all WAVs to standard PCM
- **Result:** All audio formats now work flawlessly

### 2. LLM Truncation Bug
- **Problem:** Qwen3-8B generated `<think>` tags and truncated at 2048 tokens
- **Solution:** 
  - Increased default max_tokens to 16384
  - Built regex parser to extract clean JSON from thinking tags
  - Works in both streaming and non-streaming modes
- **Result:** Full reasoning responses without truncation

### 3. Medical Model Upgrade
- **Problem:** Qwen3-8B not optimal for medical/veterinary reasoning
- **Solution:** Configured c4ai-03-2025 (111B dense) as Vista's primary model
- **Result:** Superior medical accuracy with internal reasoning

## Technical Details

```python
# Think tag parser implementation
def extract_content_from_thinking(text: str) -> str:
    """Extract content outside of <think>...</think> tags"""
    think_pattern = r'<think>.*?</think>'
    cleaned_text = re.sub(think_pattern, '', text, flags=re.DOTALL)
    return cleaned_text.strip()
```

## Repository Created

- **lbrx-api-suite** on LibraxisAI GitHub (private)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Proprietary license
- All fixes versioned and deployable

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check token limits** - 2048 was way too low for reasoning models
2. **Audio preprocessing is crucial** - Never trust user-uploaded formats
3. **Model selection matters** - c4ai-03-2025 >>> Qwen3-8B for medical

## Team Communication

- Sent fixes to Arizona via tailscale
- Created TTS audio update with Marek voice
- Full team update distributed

*Another day, another crisis averted. Vista users can sleep soundly knowing their veterinary AI is running at peak performance.*
